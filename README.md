# xyzRGB Pointcloud Rasterizer
This project contains scripts that automate the process of producing height and diffusion maps from a pointcloud file. The scripts were developed for Ubuntu but will most likely work in other Unix-based operating systems. with a few adjustements.

**WARNING:** The scripts can be extremely resource intensive depending on the size of the given pointcloud file. The **rasterize.sh** script is not fully optimized in that it creates temporary *.laz* and *.tif* files with a total size that is approximately double that of the given pointcloud file. Make sure that the necessary disk space is available when processing gigabyte-sized pointcloud files.

## Dependencies
Third party applications are invoked throughout the **rasterize.sh:** bash script. The mentioned versions are those used while the script was developed:

- [LAStools](https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools) 1.8
- [PDAL](https://pdal.io/) 1.6.0
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) 2.2.3, released 2017/11/20
- [python-gdal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/python-gdal)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) 6.9.7-4 Q16 x86_64 20170114

In Ubuntu, the latest version of these third party applications can be installed as follow:

    sudo apt install liblas-bin
    sudo apt install pdal
    sudo apt install gdal-bin
    sudo apt install python-gdal
    sudo apt install imagemagick

## Scripts
This project contains two bash scripts:
- **rasterize.sh:** Rasterizes xyzRGB pointcloud files into height and diffusion map files.
- **makemap.sh:** Create files for a 3D model environment that can be loaded into the [MARS](https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars) simulator.

### Options
Both scripts share the following options:

| Option | Description        | Default value |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| -i     | Input filename     |               |
| -h     | Height map size    | 512           |
| -d     | Diffusion map size | 4096          |
| -r     | PDAL resolution    | 0.05          |
| -t     | PDAL output type   | mean          |

Although not enforced, the diffusion map size should be a power of 2.

Regarding the PDAL options:
- **PDAL resolution:** refers to the length of raster cell edges in X/Y units. The smaller this value the higher the resolution.
- **PDAL output type:** defines the raster layer to be produced. The supported values are *min*, *max*, *mean*, *idw*, *count*, and *stdev*. There is no error checking implemented for unsupported values.

Read more about PDAL options [here](https://pdal.io/stages/writers.gdal.html#options).

The *makemap.sh* has an additional option to set the model environment name that will be specified in the produced *heightmap.yml* file:


| Option | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| -n     | Name of the model environment    |


The given map name must not include whitespaces.

### rasterize.sh
This script produces two image files and a json file with the pointcloud's bounding box information:
- heightmap.map
- diffusionmap.png
- bbox.json

#### Examples
Create height map and diffusion map image files with default parameters:

    bash rasterize.sh -i pointcloud.xyz

Create 1024x1204px height map file and 3600x3600px diffusion map file:

    bash rasterize.sh -i pointcloud.xyz -h 1024 -d 3600

### makemap.sh
This script produces the files that are part of a model environment project for the [MARS](https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars) simulator:
- README.md
- manifest.xml
- heightmap.yml
- fragment\_shader.yml
- vertex\_shader.yml
- ground.bobj

The script will invoke **rasterize.sh** if it has not been done before for the given pointcloud file.

#### Examples
Create MARS map files with default parameters:

    bash makemap.sh -n my_map_name -i pointcloud.xyz

Create MARS map files with a 1024x1204px height map file and 3600x3600px diffusion map:

    bash rasterize.sh -i pointcloud.xyz -h 1024 -d 3600

### Possible Errors
- **Memory:** Invoking PDAL can throw a *malloc* error when too low of a value is set for the resolution option. To resolve this, decrease the target resolution by increasing the value of this option (e.g. use the `-r` option to set it to 0.04 instead of the default 0.05).
- **Image output sizes:** The program will throw an error if the desired height map or diffusion map sizes are greater than that of the intermittent digital terrain model (DTM) GeoTiff file generated by PDAL (i.e. the *dtm.tif* in the tmp directory). To resolve this, either increase the resolution of the resulting DTM GeoTiff file via the `-r` option or decrease the sizes of the height and diffusion maps using the `-h` and `-d` options.
